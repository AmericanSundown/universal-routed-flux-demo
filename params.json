The main reason is that frameworks usually hide many stuff from the user, which prevents from understanding properly how things work.\r\n\r\nPlus, the Flux architecture is reasonably clean, simple and elegant by itself, so using a framework is often not necessary, especially in example code.\r\n","google":"UA-49360964-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
