<p>This demo todo app is intended for people who want to get started building universal flux applications, with modern and exciting technologies such as Reactjs, React Router and es6.</p>

<p>It consists of an example Todo Application built with flux and inspired by the Facebook Flux tutorial.</p>

<p>The app has been rewritten to be fully universal (or <del>isomorphic</del>), use es6, React Router, have a log component and provide asynchronous server communication.</p>

<p>It combines the following notions in a full-featured example:</p>

<ul>
<li>es6</li>
<li>Using React Router with server-side rendering</li>
<li>Flux architecture for universal applications</li>
<li>Multi-store application</li>
<li>Asynchronous server communication with visual feedback</li>
</ul>

<a id="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h2>

<p>This example app is here in the hope that it will help people getting started building great apps that use these recent technologies.</p>

<p>After struggling to find guides and tutorials that combined everything I wanted to build an app, I decided to write and share an example of my own.</p>

<h2>
<a id="run-the-app" class="anchor" href="#run-the-app" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Run the app</h2>

<p>The first thing you should do is clone the repo.
Then, <code>cd</code>into the project folder and run <code>npm install</code>.
This will download all the dependencies.</p>

<p>Finally, all you have to do is run <code>node entrypoint.js</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="notes" class="anchor" href="#notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes</h2>

<p>This app purposely uses no flux framework. The main reason is that frameworks usually hide many stuff from the user, which prevents from understanding properly how things work.</p>

<p>Plus, the Flux architecture is reasonably clean, simple and elegant by itself, so using a framework is often not necessary, especially in example code.</p>
